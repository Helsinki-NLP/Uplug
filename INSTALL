Installing Uplug
----------------


There is no tool for installing Uplug yet.
Most of the scripts should run on a standard GNU/Linux machine.

* You need at least a recent version of Perl (I use 5.8.0)
  You have to modify scripts in bin/ to point to your perl binary
  (the default setting is /usr/bin/perl)
* Some scripts in tools/ use bash (/bin/bash)
  You might have to adjust scripts in tools/ according to your
  installation
* Check the external programs in ext/
  External programs are pre-compiled for GNU/Linux (RedHat 9)
  Starter scripts have to be modified if necessary
	  ext/tagger
	  ext/parser
	  ext/chunker
  Some of the external programs are not included in the package. You
  might want to install them on your local machine:
