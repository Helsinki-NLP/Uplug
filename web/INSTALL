You need the following:
 - Uplug and all its modules and scripts (check that everything works!)
 - external tools used by Uplug (taggers etc)
 - Mail::Mailer (part of MailTools, needed by the CGI-script!)
   (http://search.cpan.org/~markov/MailTools-1.62/)
 - CWB and Perl modules for IMS CWB and CQP
   (ftp://ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/outgoing/cwb-beta/)
 - make for sure that all external tools exist and work on your system,
   even for web-processes! (TnT, TreeTagger, Grok, CWB) you might have to 
   adjust things in uplug/ext !!!!



* copy uplug/web/cgi-bin/uplug to your cgi-bin directory
* change variables in uplug
   UPLUGADMIN	e-mail adress of the Uplug administrator
   UPLUGLOG	log-file for the Uplug cgi-script
   UPLUGHOME	home directory of the Uplug installation
   UPLUGDATA	home directory of user data (writeable for the webserver)
   HTPASSWD	Apaches password management tool
* make the UPLUGDATA directory (writeable for the Apache web server)
  (make it accessible for you as well using a 'users' group and add a 
   sticky-bit to this directory, e.g. with 'chmod g+s UPLUGDATA')
* copy the entire directory uplug/web/cgi-bin/user to your cgi-bin directory
  (including all files even .htaccess! use the same cgi-bin directory as 
   for the uplug script!)
* modify the .htaccess file in this user directory (the one you've created)
  to point to the user authentification file .htpasswd in your UPLUGDATA dir
   AuthUserFile	UPLUGDATA/.htpasswd
* modify the uplug-server configuration (uplug/web/bin/uplug-server)
   UPLUGDATA (should be the same as above)
* start one (or more) uplug-servers (uplug/web/bin/uplug-server)
   IMPORTANT: the files .todo, .queued, .working, .done, .failed have 
              to be writeable for the uplug-server processes!!!!!!!!!


Now try the uplug-cgi script with your web-browser!
