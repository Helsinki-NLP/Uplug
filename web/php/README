ISA & ICA - 2 web interfaces for interactive alignment of parallel corpora
==========================================================================


* INSTALLING (on GNU/Linux)


- you need a running web-server with PHP installed (PHP 4 should do ...)
- copy all files and sub-directories from this directory to your web directory
  (you probably want to create a separate directory for the interfaces)
- change UPLUG and UPLUGWEB in the Makefile you just copied to your local 
  installation of Uplug (UPLUGWEB is the adress from which the web-server 
  can access Uplug)
- go to your web directory whith the ISA & ICA scripts
- run 'make' (a simple test run) or look at the Makefile to see some other 
  options to prepare a bitext for alignment
- open the index.php script in your web-browser




isa.php - the Interactive Sentence Aligner
==========================================

quickstart: run 'make' and open the isa.php script in your browser
            (this will make the files for an example corpus)

- to use your own data: read the information at the top of the Makefile 
  for make options or edit the Makefile according to your needs
- you can also make your own sub-directory in corpora/ and place your own
  configuration file there (look at the default one to see what you have
  to include)


ica.php - the Interactive Clue Aligner
======================================

quickstart: run 'make wordalign' to create config files and some
            basic clues and open the ica.php script in your browser
            (this will make the files for an example corpus)

- to use your own data: read the information at the top of the Makefile 
  for make options or edit the Makefile according to your needs
- you can also make your own sub-directory in corpora/ and place your own
  configuration file there (look at the default one to see what you have
  to include)
