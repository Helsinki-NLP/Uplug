ISA & ICA - 2 web interfaces for interactive alignment of parallel corpora
==========================================================================


* INSTALLING (on GNU/Linux)


- you need a running web-server with PHP installed (PHP 4 should do ...)
- copy all files and sub-directories from this directory to your web directory
  (you probably want to create a separate directory for the interfaces)
- change UPLUG and UPLUGWEB in the Makefile you just copied to your local 
  installation of Uplug (UPLUGWEB is the adress from which the web-server 
  can access Uplug)
- go to your web directory whith the ISA & ICA scripts
- run 'make' (a simple test run) or look at the Makefile to see some other 
  options to prepare a bitext for alignment
- open the index.php script in your web-browser



* USER MANAGEMENT

Since 2006-06-19 there is a (very) simple user management integrated in 
ISA & ICA. It can be disabled in the corpus specific configuration files
(check corpora/your_corpus/config.inc). Simply set $USER_MANAGEMENT to 0
and there will be no more login before aligning bitexts. The user management
basically consists of logging in once you start an alignment session. The user
name and password are set when logging in the first time on a particular
corpus. Both, the username and the password have to contain ASCII characters
only in the following range: a-zA-Z0-9_

It is also possible to allow multiple users to use the system. You can either
manually add users to the corpora/your_corpus/users.php file 
(username => password pairs in the $USER array) or you can enable the 
'new users allowed' option in the corpora/your_corpus/config.inc file. Using
the latter you allow EVERYONE to add new users by simply specifying a new user
name in the lgin form.

If you use the user management, then alignment results will be stored
separately for each user when hitting the 'save' buttons.




isa.php - the Interactive Sentence Aligner
==========================================

quickstart: run 'make' and open the isa.php script in your browser
            (this will make the files for an example corpus)

- to use your own data: read the information at the top of the Makefile 
  for make options or edit the Makefile according to your needs
- you can also make your own sub-directory in corpora/ and place your own
  configuration file there (look at the default one to see what you have
  to include)


ica.php - the Interactive Clue Aligner
======================================

quickstart: run 'make wordalign' to create config files and some
            basic clues and open the ica.php script in your browser
            (this will make the files for an example corpus)

- to use your own data: read the information at the top of the Makefile 
  for make options or edit the Makefile according to your needs
- you can also make your own sub-directory in corpora/ and place your own
  configuration file there (look at the default one to see what you have
  to include)
