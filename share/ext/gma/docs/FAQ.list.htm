<BR><BR><LI> <b><a name="1.1">How can I make sure that the GMA package I received is genuine?</a></b> <BR>

Verify the md5sum of the package against the md5sum listed for that package on the main download page.


<BR><BR><LI> <b><a name="1.2">How do I sign up for the GMA email lists?</a></b> <BR>

You can use the web-based interface to (un)subscribe to the moderated
<a
href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/GMA-announce">GMA-announce
	  list</a>
and the unmoderated <a
href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/GMA">GMA</a> list.

<BR><BR><LI> <b><a name="1.3">I found a bug! How do i report it?</a></b> <BR>

You can use our bugzilla server at <a href="http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/bugzilla">
http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/bugzilla</a> to report a bug.
When it asks you which component of the Proteus Project to use, pick 'GMA'.

<BR><BR><LI> <b><a name="1.4">What is a release candidate and which
version of GMA should i choose?</a></b> <BR> 

A release candidate (RC) is a pre-release of a new version of the
software.  Its purpose is to facilitate further testing, and to give
prospective users an idea of what to expect in the final
release. Unless you are a tester or developer, you should download
only final versions.

<LI> <b><a name="3.1">What is "mapping bitext correspondence" and how
is it different from inducing translation models?</a></b> <BR> 

A bitext map is a partial (ideally quite dense) relation between the
tokens and token boundaries of a text and those of its translation.
Translation models are relations between types, not tokens.  E.g., GMA
can tell you that the 3rd word in text X arose as a translation of the
4th word in X's translation Y, but it cannot tell you whether that
pair of words would be a good entry in a bilingual dictionary.
Methods exist for converting between bitext maps and translation
models, but the reliable ones are not trivial.

<LI> <b><a name="3.2">On what platforms does GMA run?</a></b> <BR>

Starting from version 2.0, GMA has been thoroughly tested on Linux/i386 and
Solaris/SPARC.  Since it is all in Java, it should in theory run the
same way on other platforms.  We know of users who have successfully
run it under Windows, but we have not done thorough testing ourselves.
    

<BR><BR><LI>
<b><a name="3.3">How efficient is GMA?</a></b> <BR>

The underlying algorithms are linear in the size of the input.
However, GMA 2.0 is the first release of a complete rewrite (in Java),
and we haven't got around to doing any serious optimization
yet. Therefore the current implementation is still very slow and
memory intensive.

<BR><BR><LI>
<b><a name="3.4">What language pairs can GMA be used for?</a></b> <BR>

We're not aware of any written languages that GMA cannot be used for.
So far, GMA has been applied to:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> French/English
<LI> Spanish/English
<LI> Korean/English
<LI> Chinese/English
<LI> Arabic/English
<LI> Czech/English
<LI> Malay/English
<LI> Russian/English
</UL>
The next version will include a module for retargeting GMA to new
language pairs.

<BR><BR><LI>
<b><a name="3.5">What language-specific resources are required/desirable
for use with GMA?  What language-specific resources are included with 
this package?</a></b> <BR>


GMA is based on an implementation of the Smooth Injective Map
Recognizer (SIMR) algorithm. SIMR works best when supplied with
language-specific information such as seed translation lexicons and
lists of stop words.  No such resources are included with this
distribution, except stop words for English, French, and Malay 
(all encoded in ISO8859-1) and an English-Malay tralex, since these 
are used in the testing suite for the program.  Even without seed
lexicons, the software can be useful for language pairs that share
lots of cognates, but performance will suffer without lists of
stopwords.  If you want to work with a language that does not use the
roman alphabet, then you definitely need a seed translation lexicon
(see the HOWTO section on matching predicates).  If you have some
resources of this type that you would like to share, we'd be happy to
include them on our resources page and give you credit.

<BR><BR><LI>
<b><a name="3.6">When should I re-optimize the GMA parameters?</a></b> <BR>

SIMR has several numerical parameters that should be re-optimized
every time you decide to use a new resource, new tokenization of the
input, new matching predicate, etc..  If you just use the default
parameters, as many people have done with Gale &amp; Church's
algorithm, the accuracy of the output may suffer greatly.  
To learn how to re-optimize the parameters, read the tech
report on "Porting..."  mentioned below, and the HOWTO-train file.

<BR><BR><LI>
<b><a name="3.last">Where can I learn more about how SIMR and GSA work?</a></b> <BR>

To better understand what this software does, we suggest you read one
or more of the following publications on this subject.
