1. Installation
---------------

   1. Type `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
      % ./configure
      You can give `configure' initial values for variables by setting
      them in the environment like this:
      % env CC=cc CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall" ./configure
      See the file `INSTALL' for detail usage of configure.

   2. Type `make'.
      % make
      This produces the system. You might have to use GNU make.

   3. Type `make install' to install programs.
      # make install
      This will install the following files.
      /usr/local/bin/chasen            ChaSen command
      /usr/local/libexec/chasen/       programs for building dictionaries
      /usr/local/lib/libchasen.*       ChaSen libraries
      /usr/local/include/chasen.h      header files
      /usr/local/share/chasen/doc/     manuals
      /usr/local/share/chasen/prolog/  Prolog programs to use ChaSen

      The following files will not be installed.
      chasen/chasen.el     	       Emacs lisp to use ChaSen
      perl/ChaSen.pm       	       Perl modules to use ChaSen

      To remove old version of ChaSen programs, type the command below.
      # rm -rf /usr/local/lib/chasen

2. How to use ChaSen system
---------------------------

   Suppose a Japanese text file `nihongo', which should be encoded in
   Japanese EUC (Extended UNIX Code) or JIS (ISO-2022-JP). Issue the
   following command:

   % chasen nihongo

   The result of the morphological analysis is shown on the standard
   output.  If your terminal has a direct input facility of Japanese
   characters, simply type 

   % chasen

   then input a Japanese sentence followed by a carrige return.

   You can use ChaSen server and its client. First, type

   % chasen -s

   to start ChaSen server. type

   % chasen -Dhost nihongo

   (`host' should be the hostname of ChaSen server) to run ChaSen
   client.
