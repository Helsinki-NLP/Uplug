This is the Perl version of the SVMTool 1.3, a very simple and effective
sequential tagger based on Support Vector Machines. A C++ version is
also availble.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install SVMTool somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

Remember to properly set 'path' and PERL5LIB variables:

set path = ($path /home/me/SVMTool-1.3/bin)
setenv PERL5LIB /home/me/SVMTool-1.3/lib:$PERL5LIB

Discussion on features and bugs of this software as well as information
about oncoming updates takes place on the SVMTool group, to which
