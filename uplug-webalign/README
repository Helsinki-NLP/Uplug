ISA & ICA - 2 web interfaces for interactive alignment of parallel corpora
==========================================================================


* INSTALLING (on GNU/Linux)

- you need a running web-server with PHP installed (PHP 4 should do ...)
- copy all files and subdirectories from uplug/web/php/ to your web directory
  (you probably want to create a separate directory for the interfaces)
- change UPLUG, UPLUGSHARE, SENTALIGNER in the Makefile to point to your local 
  installation of Uplug if you don't have a global installation of Uplug
- run 'make' (a simple test run) or look at the Makefile to see some other 
  options to prepare your own bitext for alignment
- open the index.php script in your web-browser

Alternatively, you may create your own config.inc file in a sub-directory of
corpora/ (where your corpus files should be). Make sure that the corpus
directories have to be writable for your web-browser to create necessary
output files.



* USER MANAGEMENT

Since 2006-06-19 there is a (very) simple user management integrated in 
ISA & ICA. It can be disabled in the corpus specific configuration files
(check corpora/your_corpus/config.inc). Simply set $USER_MANAGEMENT to 0
and there will be no more login before aligning bitexts. The user management
basically consists of logging in once you start an alignment session. The user
name and password are set when logging in the first time on a particular
corpus. Both, the username and the password have to contain ASCII characters
only in the following range: a-zA-Z0-9_

It is also possible to allow multiple users to use the system. You can either
manually add users to the corpora/your_corpus/users.php file 
(username => password pairs in the $USER array) or you can enable the 
'new users allowed' option in the corpora/your_corpus/config.inc file. Using
the latter you allow EVERYONE to add new users by simply specifying a new user
name in the lgin form.

If you use the user management, then alignment results will be stored
separately for each user when hitting the 'save' buttons.




isa.php - the Interactive Sentence Aligner
==========================================

quickstart: run 'make' and open the isa.php script in your browser
            (this will make the files for an example corpus)

- to use your own data: read the information at the top of the Makefile 
  for make options or edit the Makefile according to your needs
- you can also make your own sub-directory in corpora/ and place your own
  configuration file there (look at the default one to see what you have
  to include)
- if you want to use a different sentence aligner than the default one 
  (Gale&Church's length-based aligner): change $ALIGN variable in 
  the config-file for your corpus (usually in the corpora/corpusname directory)
  For example to use the subtitle aligner based on time stamps (only useful 
  for subtitle files with time information) set

$ALIGN = $UPLUGHOME.'/tools/subtitles/srtalign.pl -v c 0.6 -b -w 50';

- You can also specify several aligners in the config file using the $ALIGNPRGS
  variable. If you do so an additional select-button will appear giving the
  user the possibility to change the aligner wthout changing the config file
  The aligners have to be either the default 'align2' tool or any of the other
  sentence alignment tools included in Uplug. For example, to add subtitle
  alignments with different settings, hunalign and gma you could add the 
  following to your config file (using subtitle alignment with cognates as
  default):

$ALIGNPRGS = array(
   'Gale&Church' => $UPLUGHOME.'/ext/align/align2',
   'Hunalign' => $UPLUG.' align/hun',
   "Melamed's GMA" => $UPLUG.' align/gma',
   'Subtitle' => $UPLUGHOME.'/tools/subtitles/srtalign.pl -v',
   'Subtitle+cognates'=>$UPLUGHOME.'/tools/subtitles/srtalign.pl -v -c 0.8',
   'Subtitle+best cognates'=>$UPLUGHOME.'/tools/subtitles/srtalign.pl -v -c 0.6 -b',
);
$ALIGN = $ALIGNPRGS['Subtitle+best cognates'];

- using ISA for evaluation: add the following line to the corresponding 
  config file:

$ISA_MODE = 'eval'



ica.php - the Interactive Clue Aligner
======================================

quickstart: run 'make wordalign' to create config files and some
            basic clues and open the ica.php script in your browser
            (this will make the files for an example corpus)

- to use your own data: read the information at the top of the Makefile 
  for make options or edit the Makefile according to your needs
- you can also make your own sub-directory in corpora/ and place your own
  configuration file there (look at the default one to see what you have
  to include)
