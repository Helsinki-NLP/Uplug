Uplug - Quickstart
------------------


1) Install Uplug (see INSTALL)


2) Create a project directory (e.g. mkdir myproject)
   Temporary files will be created in this directory!


3) Go to your project directory and run some tests

     cd myproject

   Let's assume that uplug is installed in /cvs/
   Copy example files to your project directory:

     cp /cvs/uplug/example/1988sv.txt .
     cp /cvs/uplug/example/1988en.txt .
   

3a) Basic pre-processing (text --> xml)
   (a text in Swedish and English, encoded in ISO-8859-1 (latin1))

   /cvs/uplug systems/pre/basic -ci 'iso-8859-1' -in 1988sv.txt > 1988sv.xml
   /cvs/uplug systems/pre/basic -ci 'iso-8859-1' -in 1988en.txt > 1988en.xml

   Look at 1988sv.xml and 1988en.xml! Both files are (hopefully
   tokenised and marked with basic XML-tags)


3b) Sentence alignment

   source language file: 1988sv.xml
   target language file: 1988en.xml

   /cvs/uplug systems/align/sent -src 1988sv.xml -trg 1988en.xml > 1988sven.xml

   Sentence alignment pointers are stored in 1988sven.xml.
   You can read the aligned bitext segments using the following command:

   /cvs/tools/readalign 1988sven.xml | less

   Since version 0.2.0 there are additional sentence aligners integrated in
   Uplug (hunalign, GMA). Look at the HOWTO file for details!


3c) Word alignment (default)

   /cvs/uplug systems/align/word/default -in 1988sven.xml -out 1988sven.links

   This will take some time! Word alignment is slow even for this
   little bitext. The word aligner will 
     * create basic clues (Dice and LCSR)
     * run GIZA++ with standard settings (trained on plain text)
     * learn clues from GIZA's Viterbi alignments
     * "radical stemming" (take only the 3 inital characters of each token)
       and run GIZA++ again
     * align words with existing clues
     * learn clues from previous alignment
     * align words again with all existing clues

   Word alignment results are stored in 1988sven.links.
   You may look at word type links using the following script:

   /cvs/tools/xces2dic < 1988sven.links | less


3d) Word alignment (tagged)

   Use the following command for aligning tagged corpora (at least POS tags):

   cp /cvs/uplug/example/svenprf* .
   /cvs/uplug systems/align/word/tagged -in svenprf.xces -out svenprf.links

   This is essentially the same as the default word alignment with addiyional
   clues for POS and chunk labels.



3e) Tagging (using external taggers)

    There are several taggers that can be called from the Uplug
    scripts. The following command can be used to tag the English
    example corpus:

    /cvs/uplug systems/pre/en/tagGrok -in 1988en.xml > 1988en.tag


3f) Chunking (using external chunkers)

    There is a chunker for English that can be run on POS-tagged
    corpus files:

    /cvs/uplug systems/pre/en/chunk -in 1988en.tag > 1988en.chunk


3g) Word alignment evaluation

    Word alignment can be evaluated using a gold standard (reference
    links stored in another file using the same format as for the
    links produced by Uplug). There is a small gold standard for the
    example bitext used in 3f). Alignments produced above can be
    evaluated using the following command:

    /cvs/bin/evalalign.pl -gold svenprf.gold -in svenprf.links | less

    Several measures will be computed by comparing reference links
    with links proposed by the system.


3h) Word alignment (using existing clues)

    3c) and 3f) explained how to run the aligner with all its
    sub-processes. However, existing clues do not have to be computed
    each time. Existing clues can be re-used for further alignent
    runs. The user can specify the set of clues that should be used
    for aligning words. The following command runs the word aligner
    with one clue type (GIZA++ translation probabilities):

    /cvs/uplug systems/align/word/test/link -gw -in svenprf.xces -out links.new

    Weights can be set independently for each clue type. For example,
    in the example above we can specify a clue weight (e.g. 0.01) for
    GIZA++ clues using the following runtime parameter: '-gw_w 0.01'.
    Lots of different clues may be used depending on what has been
    computed before. The following table gives an overview of some
    available runtime clue-parameters.

    clue-flag      weight-flag  clue type
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -sim	   -sim_w	LCSR (string similarity)
    -dice	   -dice_w	Dice coefficient
    -mi		   -mi_w	point-wise Mututal Information
    -tscore	   -tscore_w	t-scores
    -gw		   -gw_w	GIZA++ trained on tokenised plain text
    -gp		   -gp_w	GIZA++ trained on POS tags
    -gpw	   -gpw_w	GIZA++ trained on words and POS tags
    -gwp	   -gwp_w	GIZA++ trained on word-prefixes (3 character)
    -gws	   -gws_w	GIZA++ trained on word-suffixes (3 character)
    -gwi	   -gwi_w	GIZA++ inverse (same as -gw)
    -gpi	   -gpi_w	GIZA++ inverse (same as -gp)
    -gpwi	   -gpwi_w	GIZA++ inverse (same as -gpw)
    -gwpi	   -gwpi_w	GIZA++ inverse (same as -gwp)
    -gwsi	   -gwsi_w	GIZA++ inverse (same as -gws)
    -dl		   -dl_q	dynamic clue (words)
    -dlp	   -dlp_w	dynamic clue (words+POS)
    -dp3	   -dp3_w	dynamic clue (POS-trigram)
    -dcp3	   -dcp3_w	dynamic clue (chunklabel+POS-trigram)
    -dpx	   -dpx_w	dynamic clue (POS+relative position)
    -dp3x	   -dp3x_w	dynamic clue (POS trigram+relative position)
    -dc3	   -dc3_w	dynamic clue (chunk label trigram)
    -dc3p	   -dc3p_w	dynamic clue (chunk label trigram+POS)
    -dc3x	   -dc3x_w	dynamic clue (chunk trigram+relative position)



3i) Word alignment (basic)

   There is another standard setting for word alignment:

   /cvs/uplug systems/align/word/basic -in 1988sven.xml -out basic.links

   The word aligner will 
     * create basic clues (Dice and LCSR)
     * run GIZA++ with standard settings (trained on plain text)
     * align words with existing clues

   Word alignment results are stored in basic.links.
   You may look at word type links using the following script:

   /cvs/tools/xces2dic < basic.links | less



3j) Word alignment (advanced)

    This settings is similar to the tagged word alignmen settings (3i) but the
    last two steps will be repeated 3 times (learning clues from precious
    alignments). This is the slowest standard setting for word alignment.

   /cvs/uplug systems/align/word/advanced -in svenprf.xces -out advanced.links
   /cvs/tools/xces2dic < advanced.links | less




More information about other modules will be added later.
Enjoy!
