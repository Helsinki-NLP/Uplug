This is a tiny grammar for testing and developing Grok's parsing
system.  The grammar is a small one indeed, as this is a release
(0.5.4) which has re-introduced parsing back into Grok after a several
month hiatus during which other changes have been going on.

So, it's pretty simple, and you shouldn't expect much.  Before toying
around too much, make sure you check that there isn't a later version
of Grok than 0.5.4, as later version should have considerably more
interesting parsing going on.  Anyway, for now, you can try doing the
following:

>java opennlp.grok.Grokling sample.gram

And then you can try sentences like "the cats devour mice", "the dog
sleeps", and "the cat that devours mice".  You can also try incomplete
phrases such as "the dog likes".

Not much other than that at the moment.  Lots more to come though!  I
don't recommend developing a grammar for this version of Grok since so
much is changing.

Update as of v0.5.6:

More capabilities are coming in, and the hybrid logic semantics have
improved a lot.  Here are some further examples of sentences which the
current grammar can parse.

grok> the dog likes the cat
grok> the dog gives the cat a mouse often
grok> Calvin goes to the cinema in the city
grok> the cinema that Calvin goes to likes cats
grok> the cinema that Calvin goes to likes cats that devour mice
