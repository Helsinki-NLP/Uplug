This is a small sample program that shows how to set up a pipeline and
run it on some text.  To run it, you just need to make sure that the
environment variable GROK_HOME is set to where you have installed
Grok, make sure that you have compiled Grok, and then do the following
in this directory:

./runpipe

This will compile the .java files, get the classpath sorted out and
run it.

You can play around with adding different pipelinks and running it
again to test your own pipelink components or pipeline configuration
and see the output.
