=head1 Uplug - NLP tools for processing (parallel) corpora

Uplug is a collection of tools and scripts for processing
text-corpora. Its main focus is the creation of (annotated) parallel
corpora. The toolbox is divided into several packages:

The new project home page:	L<https://bitbucket.org/tiedemann/uplug>

The old pages at SourceForge:	L<http://sourceforge.net/projects/uplug/>

=head2 Packages

C<uplug-main>: main components and scripts

C<uplug-xx>: language-specific tools and models (C<xx> = language ID)

C<uplug-treetagger>: integration of the TreeTagger

C<uplug-webalign>: webinterface for interactive alignment (ICA, ISA)

C<uplug-cwb>: tools for indexing parallel corpora for the CWB

=head2 Installation

Start by downloading the latest uplug-main tar-ball and install the main
components. This is fully functional and includes already a lot of the
main features and some annotation tools.

You may then select the language packs that you'd like to include and
install them one by one. Look at the documentation and readme's inside
of those packages.

You may also download the latest source from bitbucket and install all packages in one run:

 git clone https://bitbucket.org/tiedeman/uplug.git
 cd uplug
 make all
 sudo make install
