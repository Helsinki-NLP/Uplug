Installing Uplug
----------------


There is no tool for installing Uplug yet.
Most of the scripts should run on a standard GNU/Linux machine.

* You need at least a recent version of Perl
  You have to modify scripts in bin/ to point to your perl binary
  (the default setting is /usr/bin/perl)
* You need the following Perl modules:
  XML::Parser
  XML::Simple
  File::ShareDir
* Some scripts in tools/ use bash (/bin/bash)
  You might have to adjust scripts in tools/ according to your
  installation
* Check the external programs in share/ext/
  Some external programs are pre-compiled for GNU/Linux (see share/bin)
  Starter scripts have to be modified if necessary
	  share/ext/tagger
	  share/ext/parser
	  share/ext/chunker

  Some of the external programs are not included in the package. You
  might want to install them on your local machine:
     The TreeTagger: http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/DecisionTreeTagger.html
     The Qtag Tagger: http://web.bham.ac.uk/O.Mason/software/tagger/
     The TnT tagger: http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/~thorsten/tnt/

  - The TreeTagger is expected to be in ext/tree-tagger.
  - Qtag is expected in ext/Qtag with sub-directories for different languages
    (check startup scripts in ext/tagger/qtag_XXXXX)
  - TnT is expected in ext/tnt with a subdirectory 'models' for the language
    models (check scripts again)
