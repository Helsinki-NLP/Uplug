Installing Uplug
----------------

You can either run Uplug without explicitly installing it 
or you can run the usual perlish installation steps (for putting Uplug into a global loction)

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   sudo make install

Note: Uplug includes some pre-compiled binaries (see share/bin). You may have to compile and install your own binaries in case your OS and system architecture is not supported. Currently, there are GNU/Linux binaries (i686 and x86_64) and Intel-based Mac OSX (x86_64) binaries.

There are language-specific packages with annotation tools and pre-rpocessing pipelines. Check the Uplug website for details. Download the packages you like to use and follow there installation instructions.

-------------------

* Perl (>v5.5)
* Perl modules:
       XML::Parser
       XML::Simple
       File::ShareDir
* Java (in your global path)
* Some external tools are called via startup scripts in share/ext
  You may have to check whether they work properly (if you want to use these tools)
