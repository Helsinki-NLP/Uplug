Development of the GMA software was supported by an NSF CAREER Award, the DARPA TIDES program, and an equipment gift from Sun Microsystems.

In addition, many people have given us feedback on GMA. Some of them are probably missing from the following list. Sorry about that. However, an incomplete list is better than no list at all. In roughly chronological order, thanks to Pierre Isabelle, Michel Simard, George Foster, Elliott Macklovitch, Mitch Marcus, Lyle Ungar, Mark Lieberman, David Graff, Philip Resnik, Young-Suk Lee, Lynn Carlson, Jan Curin, Kevin Knight, Doug Oard, Ulrich Germann, David Sherohman, Jason Eisner, Mosleh Al-Adhaileh, Ruvan Weerasinghe, Kiyoshi Sudo, Rada Mihalcea.
