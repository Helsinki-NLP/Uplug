=head1 NAME

Text::ChaSen - ChaSen library module for perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Text::ChaSen;

 $res = Text::ChaSen::getopt_argv('chasen-perl', '-j', '-F', '%m ');
 $str = Text::ChaSen::sparse_tostr("日本語の文字列");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

このモジュールは、奈良先端科学技術大学が開発した日本語形態素解析
ソフトウェア"茶筅"をperlから使うためのものである。

=over 4

=item getopt_argv($arg1, $arg2, ...)

茶筅にオプションを渡し、初期化を行う。オプションは、chasenコマンド
に指定できるものに準ずるが、C<-s>やC<-D>などのサーバやクライアントに関する
オプションは利用できない。
また、一番最初のオプションはプログラムのファイル名である。

=back

例えば、次のような引数で実行したchasenコマンドがある。

$ chasen C<-j> C<-F> '%m '

これと同じ挙動をさせるには、次のような引数でgetopt_argvを呼び出す。

getopt_argv('chasen', 'C<-j>', 'C<-F>', '%m ');

=item sparse_tostr($str)

形態素解析を行い、結果を文字列として返す。

=item sparse_tostr_long($str)

形態素解析を行い、結果を文字列として返す。この関数は、以前のバージョン
との互換性のためだけに存在する。
