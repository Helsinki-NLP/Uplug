Introduction
============

MElt is a Python implementation of the MaxEnt Markov Model part-of-speech tagger
described in:

P. Denis and B. Sagot. 2009. Coupling an annotated corpus and a
morphosyntactic lexicon for state-of-the-art POS tagging with less
human effort. In Proc. of PACLIC 23, Hong Kong, China.

P. Denis and B. Sagot. 2010. Exploitation d'une ressource lexicale pour la 
construction d'un étiqueteur morphosyntaxique état-de-l'art du français.  
In Proc. of TALN 2010, Montreal, Canada.

MElt is released with an LGPL licence (see LICENCE). 


Installation
============

You first need to download the current release of the MELT tagger from
the INRIA forge:

http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/lingwb/

You can then install MElt by running the usual sequence of commands:

$> ./configure
$> make
$> make install 

The default location for the MElt executable in /usr/local/bin, so
make sure this is part of PATH variable. 

To successfully run MElt, you need to install Numpy along with a fairly 
recent version of Python --we've tried 2.5 and 2.6. 

You also need to setup the PYTHONPATH variable to the appropriate value,
such that it includes the path to MElt modules as installed by the
make install command (e.g., /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages or 
/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages)


Running the tagger
==================

The MElt tagger is run as follows:

$> cat <file> | MElt <options>

If your corpus is already tokenized and segmented in sentences (one
sentence per line), following the French Treebank
conventions (http://www.llf.cnrs.fr/Gens/Abeille/French-Treebank-fr.php),
you should use MElt with no options.

If your corpus is raw (no tokenization, no segmentation in sentences),
you can activate MElt's embedded lightweight tokenizer by using the '-t'
option. This tokenizer is a small subset of the SxPipe pre-parsing
processing chain (see Sagot & Boullier 2005, 2008). It can be invoked
independently of MElt (cat <file> | sxpipe-light).

Also, note that currently MElt only supports utf-8 encoding.
