some issues when installing on Mac OS X

* re-compile external programs (GIZA++, align, hunalign)
  --> use GIZA++ patched for GCC 4
  --> use align2.c for MAX OSX (some minor changes)
  --> use g++ instead gcc in hunalign (change Makefile)

* OS X is not case-sensitive! the startup program 'uplug' and the
  subdirectory Uplug cannot be together in the Uplug root directory!

 --> rename uplug to someting else (e.g. uplug_start) (and use
     uplug_start to start Uplug modules) 
 --> rename or delete systems/align/word/giza (because it blocks GIZA in the 
     same directory)

* install expat & XML::Parser via fink

* in ICA: adjust uplug command to use fink environment (for XML::Parser)

  change
  $command = $exec_cmd;
  to
  $command = 'test -r /sw/bin/init.sh && . /sw/bin/init.sh;'.$exec_cmd;
