- opennlp package with pre-trained models (tokenization, sentence splitting, ...)
- word alignment output in Moses format
- separate package for uplug/opus-tools
- separate package for subalign
- package for cwb-related tools?
- cleanup config files!

Annotation:

- uplug-tr: all annotation (Note: non-free tools!)
- uplug-it: annotation pipeline from trento
- uplug-is: integrate icelandic toolbox
- alternative tagger for some languages
- treetagger package (separate from all? not standard in pipeline!)


Maybe:

- integration with Lingua::Align
- integration with LetsMT tools
- webinterface for trainable sentence splitters / tokenizers
